@description
This project includes a custom orbit glow button component with two styles: a primary glowing button (`.glow-button`) and a segmented button (`.segmented-glow-button`). JavaScript logic handles toggling segment states and controlling orbital effects.

@rule
When generating buttons, use `.glow-button` for primary call-to-action buttons with a glowing hover effect, and `.segmented-glow-button` with `.segment` elements for multi-choice selections.

@rule
Do not use inline styles for these buttons. Always apply styling through the defined CSS classes.

@rule
When toggling segments in a `.segmented-glow-button`, ensure only one segment can be active at a time. Use `active` class for the selected segment and add or remove the `hide-orbit` class on the parent accordingly.

@rule
Preserve animation behavior by ensuring `.simple-glow` remains animated with `@keyframes rotating`, unless marked with `.inactive`.

@rule
Avoid modifying these classes directly; instead, create new modifiers (e.g., `.glow-button.large`) if additional customization is required.
